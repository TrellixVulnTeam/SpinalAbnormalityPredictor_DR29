# spinal-abnormality-predictor
An experiment with machine learning, jupyter notebook, and voila to create a web app.

This web application uses twelve measurements taken from a patient's x-ray and predicts whether they have a spinal abnormality or not ('Abnormal' or 'Normal').
The measurements are input using the sliders and the prediction is then calculated when the "Submit Patient Measurements" button is clicked.
The web app also displays a number of graphs of the original dataset that shows relationships between various attributes.

Note: This is a computer science final project and has neither been reviewed nor approved for any kind of actual medical diagnosis.
